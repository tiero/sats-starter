## About

- Donors can fund campaigns using any Lightning Network wallet.
- To receive, the beneficiary does not need to set up a LN node.
- The crowdfund campaign has a capped goal; if it is not reached, donors can claim their money back.
- After the goal is reached, the beneficiary can redeem on Liquid using only a private key.
